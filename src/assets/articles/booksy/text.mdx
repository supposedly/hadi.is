This was a website I built for my first year in [FBLA](https://www.fbla-pbl.org), a competitive-event do
for high-schoolers. My prompt was to make a standalone piece of software for managing a virtual library. I don't quite
know about *standalone*, but it looks like they let it slide :)

I was pretty proud of this project. I worked harder on it than I'd ever worked on anything before, and it basically taught
me Python, JavaScript+Angular, and SQL all in one go! It had a login/signup system for managing and separating different libraries,
a really complicated (but working!) system of roles and privileges,
comprehensive help docs, and a whole bunch of other cool stuff.
