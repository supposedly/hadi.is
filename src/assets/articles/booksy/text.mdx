This was a website I built for my first year in [FBLA](https://www.fbla-pbl.org), a competitive-event do
for high-schoolers. My prompt was to make a standalone piece of software for managing a virtual library. I don't quite
know about *standalone*, but hey, they let it slide :)

I was pretty proud of this. I worked harder on it than anything I'd ever worked on before, and it basically taught
me Python, JavaScript+Angular, and SQL all in one go!

I also got some practice working with logins/signups and
email verification, implementing (a super-overcomplicated-but-still-working system of) roles and privileges, writing
comprehensive help articles, and lots more.
