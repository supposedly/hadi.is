Welcome â€” especially if you got here from my resume! Here's a portfolio page I've put together. You can hit
the arrows or the thumbnails up top to look through some of my projects.

This website counts as a project, by the way, so into the portfolio it goes too. I made it because I needed
a quick\* showcase of the stuff I've done that gets across best with a picture or video, particularly things
like <ArticleLink n="nutshell">nutshell</ArticleLink> or my <ArticleLink n="wacomophone">drawing-tablet
musical keyboard</ArticleLink>. It also serves as a fun hub for anything I do or care about professionally.

Now, it definitely ended up taking me a few months longer than "quick", but I've had a great time
getting used to React and Gatsby nonetheless. It's even let me round out my earlier encounters
with <ArticleLink n="booksy">Angular</ArticleLink> and <ArticleLink n="lebnxyz">Vue</ArticleLink> to finish
up the SPA-framework triathlon. Svelte is up next :)

Also: a huge thank-you to [Tyler Finck](https://tylerfinck.com) for publishing *Epilogue*,
the beautiful typeface I'm using in my article bodies.
