Welcome, especially if you got here from my resume! Hope you can stick around and check out some of the projects
I've got on this page. Hit the arrows or the thumbnails up top to walk through the portfolio.

Anyway, this website counts as a project, so it goes in the portfolio too! I made it because I needed a
quick showcase of some of the stuff I've made that needs a picture or a video to get across well, especially
projects like
<ArticleLink n="nutshell">nutshell</ArticleLink> or my <ArticleLink n="wacomophone">drawing-tablet
musical keyboard</ArticleLink>. It also serves as a fun hub for anything I care about or do professionally.

And sure enough, it ended up taking me a few months longer than "quick", but I had a lot of fun getting used to React
and Gatsby nonetheless. I even got to finish my SPA-framework triathlon along the way, first running
<ArticleLink n="booksy">Angular</ArticleLink> and then <ArticleLink n="lebnxyz">Vue</ArticleLink>, although I
wouldn't bet on having set any records...

A huge thank-you to [Tyler Finck](https://tylerfinck.com) for publishing *Epilogue*, the beautiful typeface I'm
using in my article bodies.
