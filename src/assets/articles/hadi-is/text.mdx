Welcome — especially if you got here from my resume! Here's a portfolio page I've put together. You can hit
the arrows or the thumbnails up top to look through some of my projects.

This website counts as one, by the way, so it goes into the portfolio too! I made it because I needed a
quick\* showcase of the stuff I've done that gets across best with a picture or video, especially projects like
<ArticleLink n="nutshell">nutshell</ArticleLink> or my <ArticleLink n="wacomophone">drawing-tablet
musical keyboard</ArticleLink>. It also serves as a fun hub for anything I do or care about professionally.

Now, it's ended up taking me a few months longer than "quick", but I've had a great time
getting used to React and Gatsby nonetheless. I even got to complete my SPA-framework triathlon along the way,
rounding out my earlier encounters with <ArticleLink n="booksy">Angular</ArticleLink> and
<ArticleLink n="lebnxyz">Vue</ArticleLink>.

And on a final note: a huge thank-you to [Tyler Finck](https://tylerfinck.com) for publishing *Epilogue*,
the beautiful typeface I'm using in my article bodies.
