# Caterer

<GIF n="result" float="left" marginRight="1em" />

Caterer's a Discord bot for the unofficial-but-okay-kind-of-official [Conwaylife](https://conwaylife.com/forums) Discord
community that I started. Its humble beginnings as a [wiki](https://conwaylife.com/wiki)-retrieval bot quickly gave way
to the thought that we could use it to simulate cellular automata for us, without ever having to leave Discord!

So the command of this bot's that we use the most is `!sim`, which looks for a run-length-encoded pattern copied from
[Golly](http://golly.sourceforge.net), pops it back into its own copy of Golly, and returns a GIF simulating its evolution.
The GIF at the top here is just an eye-catching pattern from a rule called `slantPinski` (slanted Sierpinski triangles, anyone?),
which "Redstoneboi" from the community devised, and to the right is a screenshot of how you get that out of Caterer in the
first place.
