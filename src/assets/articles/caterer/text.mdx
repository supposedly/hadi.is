# Caterer

<GIF n="result" scale={0.5} float="left" />

Caterer is a Discord bot for the unofficial [Conwaylife](https://conwaylife.com/forums) Discord
community. Its humble beginnings as a [wiki](https://conwaylife.com/wiki)-retrieval bot quickly gave way
to the thought that we could use it to simulate cellular automata for us, without ever having to leave Discord. I go into
more detail on "cellular automata" in the <ArticleLink n="nutshell">nutshell</ArticleLink> writeup, but the important
thing here is that they make for some cool GIFs!

So the command of this bot's that we use the most is `!sim`, which takes a pattern of cells in
[Golly](http://golly.sourceforge.net)'s run-length-encoded format, pops it back into its own copy of Golly,
and returns a GIF simulating its evolution.
The GIF to the left here is just an eye-catching Sierpinski-triangle pattern designed by "Redstoneboi" from the community,
and to the right is a screenshot of the encoded version of that pattern that lets you get that GIF out of
Caterer.

The bot's recently turned into a community effort, with a lot of substantial contributions from members of the
Discord server. I'm super happy about getting to foster that kind of engagement!
