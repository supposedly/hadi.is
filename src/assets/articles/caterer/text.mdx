# Caterer

<GIF n="result" scale={0.5} float="left" marginRight="1em" />

Caterer's a Discord bot for the unofficial [Conwaylife](https://conwaylife.com/forums) Discord
community. Its humble beginnings as a [wiki](https://conwaylife.com/wiki)-retrieval bot quickly gave way
to the thought that we could use it to simulate cellular automata for us, without ever having to leave Discord. I go into
more detail on "cellular automata" in the <ArticleLink n="nutshell">nutshell</ArticleLink> article, but the important
thing here is that they make for some cool GIFs!

So the command of this bot's that we use the most is `!sim`, which looks for a run-length-encoded pattern copied from
[Golly](http://golly.sourceforge.net), pops it back into its own copy of Golly, and returns a GIF simulating its evolution.
The GIF to the left here is just an eye-catching Sierpinski-triangle pattern devised by "Redstoneboi" from the community,
and to the right is a screenshot of the run-length-encoded version of that pattern that lets you get that GIF out of
Caterer.
