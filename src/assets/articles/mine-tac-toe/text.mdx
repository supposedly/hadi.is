# mine-tac-toe

[I wanted to see](https://github.com/supposedly/mine-tac-toe) how a mashup of Tic-Tac-Toe and
Minesweeper would work.

It... erm. It sure is a mashup of Tic-Tac-Toe and Minesweeper. Yup.

<Image n="board" float="left" />

<!--
  I don't know why because it's been over a year since I wrote all this CSS but I
  have to float=left or float=right to get that image to center...
-->
