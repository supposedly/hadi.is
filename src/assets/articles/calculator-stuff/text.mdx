# Calculator fun

<Video n="odd-one-out" scale={0.4} float="left" marginRight="1em" />

One day in 8th grade, this guy in my video-editing class, Johan,
wrote me a quick program on my calculator that could calculate the slope of a line.

I didn't even know my calculator could *do* that. But that was it.
That's all it took to get me hooked on all this "programming" stuff. So before there was Python
and whatever, there was TI-BASIC, and you can bet I was there for it!

I spent all of 8th grade going deeper and deeper into calculator programming. I had a bunch of projects going on
at the time, like a Fruit Ninja clone that never made it to (ahem) fruition, but I think I only ever finished a few
games and a strange esolang interpreter.

The video above is my adaption of a color-matching game called *Odd One Out* (recorded thanks to
[jsTIfied](https://www.cemetech.net/projects/jstified/), and this one to the right was my first project ever:
a platformer game!
