# Calculator stuff

<Video n="odd-one-out" scale={0.4} float="left" marginRight="1em" />

One day in 8th grade, the dude who sat next to me in my video-editing class, Johan,
showed me a quick program on my calculator that could calculate the slope of a line.

I didn't even know my calculator could *do* that. But that was it.
That's all it took to get me hooked on this programming stuff.

So before there was Python and whatever, there was TI-BASIC, and you can bet I was there! I had
a bunch of projects going on back then, but I think I only ever published a few on [Cemetech](https://cemetech.net).
The video above is my adaption of a color-matching game called *Odd One Out* to the calculator,
and <GIF n="move3" scale={0.7} float="right" marginLeft="1em" /> this one to the right is a platformer (also my first
project ever, if memory serves) I called MOVE3.

<GIF scale={0.7} n="move3boss" float="left" marginRight="1em" />

I had a boss fight in the works, but that never made it to fruition :(
