Lebanese Arabic is a native language of mine, but I don't speak it perfectly. I was raised in America and largely in English, so my Lebanese vocabulary is just lacking a lot of the time. I'm always wishing I had an easy way to look up some Lebanese word that I'm not sure how to use.

But pretty much the only place you can find good documentation of Arabic vernaculars like Lebanese is in academic literature. Other attempts at recognizing non-Standard Arabic are all over the place, especially online ones; even great projects like [Lughatuna](https://livingarabic.com/dictionaries), [mo3jam](https://mo3jam.com), and Arabic on [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki) are just plain flawed when it comes down to it. And none of them are exactly comprehensive, to boot.

And that sucks! Like, the Arabic spoken throughout Lebanon alone, a country hardly bigger than Rhode Island and Delaware put together, varies even more than English does — no joke — across the entire United States. I just hate to let that go unappreciated. So how do we capture all of that variation, and how do we make it accessible to anyone at all who might be interested in it?

Well, [lebn.xyz](https://lebn.xyz) is going to be a dictionary for Lebanese Arabic, and I'm developing it in the humble hopes of making it the best dictionary online — period. It's going to automatically take care of tedia like inflecting individual words, grouping together variant forms, and enumerating all the possible pronunciations of a given word; it's going to provide a friendly interface for exploring all sorts of lexical relationships and trivia that could never be enumerated by hand; and it's going to come with an easy-to-take survey whose questions and results will be integrated into just about every page in the dictionary.

The idea is to provide similar websites to other Arabic varieties in due time, and maybe even to other under-documented languages eventually. But that's all super-forward thinking. For the moment, development has been proceeding slowly and in stages, and everything else will come after this first website itself is usable.

There is a single small part of it that I can show off from now, though. Back in summer 2019, I sent out an informal online survey to a community of Lebanese folks, and I banged out a map/visualization of the results several months later. That's viewable in the image above and at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/lebnxyz/lebmap), and it's a sneak peek of what that one feature of the completed dictionary is going to look like!
