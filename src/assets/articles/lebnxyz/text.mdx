[lebn.xyz](https://lebn.xyz) is going to be a dictionary for Lebanese Arabic, and I'm developing it in the humble hopes of making it the best dictionary online. It's going to automatically take care of tedia like inflecting individual words, grouping together variant forms, and enumerating all the possible pronunciations of a given word; it's going to provide a friendly interface for exploring all sorts of lexical relationships and trivia that could never be enumerated by hand; and it's going to come with an easy-to-take survey whose questions and results will be integrated into just about every page in the dictionary.

It's nowhere near finished at the moment, as development has been proceeding in stages. Back in summer 2019, I sent out an informal online survey and banged out a visualization of the results several months later; that's viewable above, and it's a sneak peek of what that one small portion of the completed dictionary is going to look like!
