Lebanese Arabic is a native language of mine, but I don't speak it perfectly. I was raised in America and largely in
English, so my Lebanese vocabulary is just lacking a lot of the time. I'm always wishing I had an easy way to look
up some Lebanese word that I'm not sure how to use.

But pretty much the only place you can find good documentation of Arabic vernaculars like Lebanese is in academic
literature. Other attempts at recognizing non-Standard Arabic are all over the place, especially online ones; even
great projects like [Lughatuna](https://livingarabic.com/dictionaries), [mo3jam](https://mo3jam.com), and Arabic on
[Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki) are just plain flawed when it comes down to it.

And that sucks! Like, the Arabic spoken throughout Lebanon alone, a country hardly bigger than Rhode Island and
Delaware put together, varies even more than English does across the entire United States. And I just hate
to let that go unappreciated. How do we capture all of that variation, and how do we make it accessible to anyone
at all who might be interested in it?

Well, [lebn.xyz](https://lebn.xyz) is going to be a dictionary for Lebanese Arabic, and I'm developing it in the
humble hopes of making it a Really Good Dictionary â€” by any measure. It's going
to automatically take care of tedia like inflecting individual words, grouping together variant forms, and enumerating
all the possible pronunciations of a given word; it's going to provide a friendly interface for exploring all sorts of
lexical relationships and trivia that you could never list out by hand; and it's going to come with an easy-to-take
survey whose questions and results will be integrated into just about every page in the dictionary.

It's not anywhere near done, but there's a single small part of it that I can show off from now: back in summer 2019,
I sent out an informal online survey to a community of Lebanese folks, and I banged out a map/visualization of
the results several months later. That's viewable in the image to the right as well as at
[this GitHub repository](https://github.com/lebnxyz/lebmap), so there's a small sneak peek at just one part of
the final dictionary!

And I started working on something new in December 2020, but between school, life, and my brainpower's spotty coverage
in my region, this entire year's blown by and I still have yet to finish it up. I did try to
[write about it](https://github.com/supposedly/exploring-lebanese-arabic#readme) in the meantime, though, and I hope
that that's a good preview of what I've got coming up next.
