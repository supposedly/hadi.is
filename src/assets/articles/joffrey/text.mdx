# joffrey

[Joffrey](https://github.com/supposedly/joffrey) is a command-line-argument parser I wrote because I needed a simple way to
define AND/OR/XOR relationships between different CLI arguments and flags.

All there is to it, really. `AND` is "this flag/argument needs these other flags/arguments", `OR` is "this flargument is
cool with having these other ones, but it doesn't need them", and `XOR` is "this flargument isn't on speaking terms
with these other ones."

I'm not the first to come up with that by a long shot, but it turns out it's a pretty useful way of thinking about a lot
of things. An iteration of the same idea is informing a huge part of the dictionary at lebn.xyz (last project here)!
