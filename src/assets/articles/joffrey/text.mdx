# joffrey

[Joffrey](https://github.com/supposedly/joffrey) is a command-line-argument parser I wrote because I needed a simple way to
define AND/OR/XOR relationships between different CLI arguments and flags.

```py
from joffrey import CLI, Group

cli = CLI('Quick demo program')
# CLI.__setattr__() on Group objects is special-cased slightly
cli.sc = Group(XOR=0)  # 0 is just an identifier; it can be anything


@cli.arg()
def name(name):
    """Args, positional, are parsed in the order they're added in"""
    return name

@cli.sc.clump(AND='blah')
@cli.sc.flag(short='S')
def scream(text):
    """I have no mouth and I must ... yeah"""
    return text.upper()

@cli.sc.clump(AND='blah')  # this flag and `scream` *must* appear together (same AND)
@cli.sc.flag('verbosity', namespace={'count': 0})
def verbose(nsp):
    """This does nothing but it shows namespaces (which are always passed as the first arg)"""
    if nsp.count < 3:
        nsp.count += 1
    return nsp.count

@cli.clump(XOR=0)  # this flag *cannot* appear alongside any in group `sc` (same XOR)
@cli.flag('addition')
def add(a: int = 4, *b: int):  # can also provide default args and a type-coercion hint if needed
    """Who needs a calculator"""
    return a + sum(b)
```


All there is to it, really. `AND` is "this flag/argument (flargument) needs these other flarguments",
`OR` is "this flargument is cool with having these other ones, but it doesn't need them", and `XOR` is
"this flargument isn't on speaking terms with these other ones."

```py
>>> cli.parse('foo -S "test test" -vvvv')  # input will be shlex.split if given as a string (defaults to sys.argv though)
JoffreyNamespace(name='foo', scream='TEST TEST', verbosity=3)
>>> 
>>> cli.parse('foo -v')
# <help/usage info...>
Expected all of the following flags/arguments: 'scream', 'verbosity'
(Got 'verbosity')
>>> 
>>> cli.parse('foo --add 1 6')
JoffreyNamespace(addition=7, name='foo')
>>> 
>>> cli.parse('foo -a')  # same as `foo --add`; default short alias is first letter of name (`short=None` removes entirely)
JoffreyNamespace(addition=4, name='foo')
>>> 
>>> cli.parse('foo -a 1 2 -S "this is gonna error" -v')
# <help/usage info...>
Expected no more than one of the following flags/arguments: 'addition', ['scream', 'verbosity']
(Got 'addition', ['scream', 'verbosity'])
>>> 
>>> # etc
```

I'm not the first to come up with that by a long shot, but it turns out it's a pretty useful way of thinking about a lot
of things. An iteration of the same idea is informing a huge part of the dictionary at <ArticleLink n="lebnxyz">lebn.xyz</ArticleLink>!
