## &amp;copy;

&amp;copy; is a quick browser extension I made to parse HTML entity codes (like `&copy;` or `&#169;`) into the characters they represent (like ©). Pretty useful when you need to use a lot of characters in quick succession that aren't on your keyboard, like when I transliterate Arabic: *al-luḡatu l-ʿarabīyah*. My previous best bet was Googling the individual characters I needed and copy/pasting them one-by-one, which is decidedly... not as fun!
