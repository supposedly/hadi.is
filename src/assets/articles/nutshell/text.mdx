There's a community of enthusiasts, mostly over at [Conwaylife](https://conwaylife.com/forums), that use programs
like [Golly](https://golly.sourceforge.net) to explore *cellular automata:* simulations that put cells on a grid and
make them interact with neighboring cells according to specific rules.

That's all there is to it, really, but the appeal is that even simple rules can give rise to hosts of crazy-complex
interactions. The most-famous cellular automaton in this respect is Conway's Game of Life, devised by mathematician
John Conway (RIP 2020) in the 1960s.

Conway's Game of Life is awesome, and you can [look it up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)
to find out more about how it works and why people like it. But it's not even the only CA there is!
So Golly, the software from earlier, actually lets you explore all sorts of different CA
with a sort of built-in programming language: you can feed it a bunch of rules like "if a blue cell is
surrounded by three yellow neighbors, it transitions into a yellow cell", which translates into a whole
cellular-automaton system of your own definition. And it's a comprehensive, complete language, so it lets you
describe any CA that Golly could possibly simulate. But! It's pretty primitive. It's just way lower-level than is
helpful sometimes, and it really loves making you repeat yourself, which makes it hard to keep track of everything
going on in a more-complex CA.

Personally, I had the idea one day to implement [Brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) as a cellular automaton.
But doing it in Golly's CA language would have me writing about a thousand lines of code by hand, most of them redundant...
and, boy, does that not sound like a fun time! [So I wrote over three thousand lines of code instead.](https://xkcd.com/1319/)

Long story short, it worked well enough, and over to the right is the very first rule I ever compiled with Nutshell: the
[Biham–Middleton–Levine traffic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biham%E2%80%93Middleton%E2%80%93Levine_traffic_model) —
which I don't have any practical use for, but it's easy to model and it looks pretty cool. And then, with a good 4 months of
stop-and-start work, I managed to finish my Brainfuck rule! There it is at the very top of this page, running the following
program that outputs the text `Hello, world!`:

```brainfuck
