There's a community of enthusiasts, mostly over at [Conwaylife](https://conwaylife.com/forums), that use programs
like [Golly](https://golly.sourceforge.net) to explore *cellular automata:* simulations that put cells on a grid and
make them interact with neighboring cells according to specific rules.

That's all there is to it, really, but the appeal is that even simple rules can give rise to hosts of crazy-complex
interactions. The most-famous cellular automaton in this respect is Conway's Game of Life, devised by mathematician
John Conway (RIP 2020) in the 1960s.

Conway's Game of Life is awesome, and you can look it up to find out more about how it works and why people like it.
But there are a whole lot more CA out there to explore! So Golly, the software from earlier, actually lets you make
up your own with a sort of built-in programming language: you can feed it a bunch of rules like "if a blue cell is
surrounded by three yellow neighbors, it transitions into a yellow cell" and that translates into a whole
cellular-automaton system for you to explore. But the problem's that this language is pretty primitive. It lets you
describe any CA that Golly could possibly simulate, so it's definitely complete, but it's way lower-level than is
helpful sometimes.

Personally, I had the idea one day to implement [Brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) as a cellular automaton.
But doing it in Golly's CA language would have me writing about a thousand lines of code by hand, most of them redundant...
and, boy, does that not sound like a fun time! [So I wrote 3,415 lines of code instead.](https://xkcd.com/1319/)

Over to the right is the
[Biham–Middleton–Levine traffic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biham%E2%80%93Middleton%E2%80%93Levine_traffic_model),
the very first rule I ever compiled with Nutshell. It's pretty easy to model and it looks cool. I eventually worked my way
up to Brainfuck, which is the video up top :)
