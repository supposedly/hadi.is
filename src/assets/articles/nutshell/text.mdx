There's a community of enthusiasts, mostly over at [Conwaylife](https://conwaylife.com/forums), that use programs
like [Golly](https://golly.sourceforge.net) to explore *cellular automata:* simulations that put cells on a grid and
make them interact with neighboring cells according to specific rules.

That's all there is to it, really, but the appeal is that even simple rules can give rise to hosts of crazy-complex
interactions. The most-famous cellular automaton in this respect is Conway's Game of Life, devised by mathematician
John Conway (RIP 2020) in the 1960s.

Conway's Game of Life is awesome, and you can [look it up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)
to find out more about how it works and why people like it. But it's not even the only CA there is!
Golly, the software from earlier, actually lets you explore all kinds of different ones
with a sort of built-in programming language: you feed it a bunch of rules like "if a blue cell is
surrounded by three yellow neighbors, it transitions into a yellow cell", and that translates into a whole
cellular-automaton system of your own definition. And it's a comprehensive, complete language, so it lets you
describe any CA that Golly could possibly simulate.

But it's pretty primitive. It's just way lower-level than is helpful sometimes, and it really loves making you
repeat yourself, which makes it hard to keep track of everything going on in a more-complex automaton.

Personally, I had the idea one day to implement [Brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) as a cellular automaton.
But doing it in Golly's CA language would have me writing about a thousand lines of code by hand, most of them redundant...
and, boy, does that not sound like a fun time. So I took the sensible way out by
[writing over 3,000 lines of code instead.](https://xkcd.com/1319/)

Long story short, it worked super well, and over to the right is the very first rule ever compiled with Nutshell: the
[Biham–Middleton–Levine traffic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biham%E2%80%93Middleton%E2%80%93Levine_traffic_model)!
(I don't have any practical use for it, but it's easy to implement and it looks pretty cool.) And then, with a good 4 months of
stop-and-start work, I got Brainfuck up and running. There it is at the very top of this page, running the following
program that outputs the text `Hello, world!`:

```brainfuck
++++++++

    [>++>+++>+++>+<<<<-]

+++++ +++               Set Cell #0 to 8
[
    >++++               Add 4 to Cell #1; this will always set Cell #1 to 4
    [                   as the cell will be cleared by the loop
        >++             Add 4*2 to Cell #2
        >+++            Add 4*3 to Cell #3
        >+++            Add 4*3 to Cell #4
        >+              Add 4 to Cell #5
        <<<<-           Decrement the loop counter in Cell #1
    ]                   Loop till Cell #1 is zero
    >+                  Add 1 to Cell #2
    >+                  Add 1 to Cell #3
    >-                  Subtract 1 from Cell #4
    >>+                 Add 1 to Cell #6
    [<]                 Move back to the first zero cell you find; this will
                        be Cell #1 which was cleared by the previous loop
    <-                  Decrement the loop Counter in Cell #0
]                       Loop till Cell #0 is zero

The result of this is:
Cell No :   0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Contents:   0   0  72 104  88  32   8
Pointer :   ^

>>.                     Cell #2 has value 72 which is 'H'
>---.                   Subtract 3 from Cell #3 to get 101 which is 'e'
+++++ ++..+++.          Likewise for 'llo' from Cell #3
>>.                     Cell #5 is 32 for the space
<-.                     Subtract 1 from Cell #4 for 87 to give a 'W'
<.                      Cell #3 was set to 'o' from the end of 'Hello'
+++.----- -.----- ---.  Cell #3 for 'rl' and 'd'
>>+.                    Add 1 to Cell #5 gives us an exclamation point
>++.                    And finally a newline from Cell #6
```
