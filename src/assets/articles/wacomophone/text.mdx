Ever wanted to play an instrument with so much latency that it's impossible to keep a rhythm going?
I sure have! The video is a rare good take of Fur Elise on this drawing-tablet-turned-keyboard thing that I wrote one
weekend just to see what it'd play like.

Dunno if I'd make a career out of it. Pretty fun, though.
