<Video n={0} float="left" hasSound />

Ever wanted to play an instrument with so much latency that it's impossible to keep a tempo going?
I sure have! The video is a rare good take of Fur Elise on this drawing-tablet-turned-keyboard thing that I wrote one
weekend just to see what it'd play like.

Dunno if I'd make a career out of it. Pretty fun, though. If I can revisit it and fix the latency problem,
I might try making use of the buttons to do even funner things like shifting pitch and recording & looping samples.
