# WACOMophone

<Video n={0} float="left" marginRight="1em" autoplay={false} />

Ever wanted to play an instrument with so much latency that it's impossible to keep a good rhythm going?
I sure haven't! The video's a rare good take of Fur Elise on this WACOMOphone thing that I wrote one
weekend just to see what it'd play like.

Pretty fun. I dunno if I'd make a career out of it, though.
